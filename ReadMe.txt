The dataset used in this analysis is digital marketing campaign data, which involved
creation of banners. Banners are nothing but the images displayed on the social media
sites such as facebook, advertising a specific product, that may be related to banks,
food retail companies, mobile phones etc.

These banners are personalized and target the customer having specific demographic
characterstics, and interests. The demographic characterstics have elements such as
age, sex, location, language etc. The interests may be elements such as video games,
travelling, adventure sport etc.

This data has nearly 19,264 rows and 34 columns. The columns include information about
common KPIs used in Digital Marketing such as impressions, reach, click through rate.

I have first analysed the data using exploratory data analysis, and then I have used
K-means clustering to cluster the similar ads.
